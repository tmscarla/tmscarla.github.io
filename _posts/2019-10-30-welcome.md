**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹ 

I want to inaugurate my first personal blog with a hope for the (near) future. I would like the purpose of this place to be two-fold: on one hand it can help to enhance my English level, pushing me to seek unkown terms and idioms, refining the way I express myself in a different language. On the other hand, I think it can be healthy to put one's thougs on black and white sometimes, to take a snapshot of your mindset in a precise moment, in order to have a chance to retrieve and analyze it afterwards.

Well, that's all for my first post. I really hope to keep this place aligned with what comes up in my mind!
