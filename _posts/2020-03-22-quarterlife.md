<p>
On the 30th of April I turned twenty-five years old, a quarter of a century.<br>
I used to love my birthday, since it is always a moment of profound reflection, in which I try to gather everything that happened in the last year, in order to create an ideal summary to guide my future actions.
</p>

<p>
This year is kind of different. We are currently facing a world-wide pandemic which seems to never end and which will probably change ourselves forever in the way we think, act and behave.
</p>

<p>
I have read a lot about quarter-life crisis: how it shows up and its symptoms, but I will be honest: it hit me with a direct straight punch. 
<br>
Suddenly I felt like everything that I have been working on so far in my life had no meaning:
my thesis, my whole academic path, my future job. Even what I care the most was falling apart inside my head: my family, my friends, my passions. It is a terrible sensation to experience something like that. Being completely emptied, with no purposes and unable to see a viable solution to escape.
</p>

<p>
I really have to say thank you to my family and my close friends, who helped me through this tough period with their commendable support and guidance. Life is a little bit less scary if you are not fighting alone.
</p>

<p>
How did I figure out what to do? How did I manage to solve it? Actually is kind of hard to explain, since it is an inner fighting that you are facing and eventually you are the only one who can act directly on the issue. <br>
Personally, I took a moment for myself to deeply reflect on what I have achieved so far in all the nuances of my life, spanning from school, work, friends and love. This was the starting point to evaluate what was good and what was bad for me and to determine what to do to achieve a status of quietude in my life.
</p>

<p>
That is probably the most important take-a-home point that I have learned. No matter how many great things you can achieve in your life, they are all pointless if you don't have the chance and the time to appreciate them in the right manner.
</p>

<p>
To a calm, humble and happy life.
