The next 30th of April I will be twenty-five years old, a quarter of a century.<br>
When I am approaching my birthday it is always a moment of profound reflection, in which I try to gather everything that happened in the last year, in order to create an ideal summary to guide my future actions.

This year is kind of different. We are in the middle of a world-wide pandemic which will probably change ourselves forever in the way we think, act and behave.
