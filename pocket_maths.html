<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>An iOS app with mathematics lectures, exercises, and exam tests for high school students.</h3>
<br>

<p> 
In 2013, during my last year of high school at Liceo Scientifico G. Castelnuovo, I developed an iOS app which gathered lectures, exercises and exams from my maths and physics professor. The design and the development of the application was a jointly effort between a passionate classmate, <b>Federico Baldi Lanfranchi</b>, and me. The support of our professor, <b>Francesco Parigi</b>, was really generous. He gave us the possibility to use his material with no limitations, and helped us developing some of the utilities.
</p>
<p>
It has been a really educational project, that gave us the possibility to give some "lectures" to other students and professors and to have two interviews with two local journals (<i>La Nazione, Il Corriere Fiorentino</i>) as shown below. We also created a startup with the fancy name "SB AppStudios", which recalled the initials of our last names.
