<h3 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}class="text-white"{% endif %}>A web platform to help college and high school students to find selected tutors.</h3>
<br>

<p>
In 2015 I was involved, with two other students from the Bocconi University, in the development of a new platform to promote the encounter between students and tutors, creating a new form of tutoring, a "Tutoring 2.0". (<a href="http://www.tenbuilders.it">http://www.tenbuilders.it</a>)
</p>
<p>
The idea that drove us is that tutoring can be extremely expensive and even unreliable in terms of expected outcome (i.e. grades). With Tenbuilders we wanted to create a platform in which only fresh, selected tutors can offer their knowledge of different areas of expertise 
for a modest price between 10-18â‚¬. The tutoring system was active in three main cities in Italy (Milan, Rome, Florence) and could be arranged via Skype call too.

Three are the key ideas on which the platform was built on:
<br>
<ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
	<li> <b>Simplicity</b>: an easy and effortless way to find a tutor.</li>
	<li> <b>Competence</b>: only selected tutors are part of the Tenbuilders network.</li>
	<li> <b>Saving</b>: tutoring with modest prices between 10-18â‚¬.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
For what concerns the development of the platform, we relied on a Wordpress theme with some useful plugins to build the front-end. The backend was simply a MySQL database with tutors records which were retrieved whenever a customer was looking for a tutoring session.
We also used newly introduced CSS3 <i>transitions</i> to enhance the user experience in a lightweight way.
</p>

<p>
I also supervised the design of the platform, creating the logo which shows a "10" that is slowly built by solid bricks. This represents clearly the message of our platform: solid academic success can be achieved following the guidance of our tutors.
